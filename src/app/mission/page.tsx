              Many people have asked us an important question: <strong className="text-brandBlue italic">“Why are we organizing the Vishwa Leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar International Awards in London and not in India?”</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This is a valid question, and we would like to explain the larger vision behind this mission.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              First, let us be very clear: <strong className="text-slate-900">India is the birthplace of Babasaheb Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, and no country can ever replace India’s importance in his legacy.</strong> Babasaheb belongs to India, and his contribution to our nation is eternal.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              However, <strong className="text-slate-900">Babasaheb’s vision was never meant to remain limited to India alone.</strong> His ideals of <strong className="text-slate-900">equality, liberty, fraternity, social justice, human dignity, and constitutional values</strong> are universal values meant for the entire world.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-brandBlue border-l-4 border-brandBlue pl-4 py-1 my-8 bg-brandBlue/5">
              That is precisely why we chose London as the launchpad of this historic global mission.
            </p>

            <p>
              London is one of the world’s most influential global centres — a city where international leaders, policymakers, academicians, entrepreneurs, media houses, and global communities converge. A message launched from London gains worldwide visibility and can reach every continent much faster.
            </p>

            <p>
              London also carries deep emotional and historical significance in Babasaheb’s life. It was here that Babasaheb pursued higher education at London School of Economics and Gray's Inn, shaping the intellectual, legal, and economic foundation that later transformed India.
            </p>

            <p>
              We must remember one important fact: <strong className="text-slate-900">Babasaheb himself traveled from India to the world to gain knowledge.</strong> He went to London, the USA, and other countries not for personal luxury, but to acquire world-class education, ideas, legal understanding, economic knowledge, and global exposure. He studied at Columbia University, the London School of Economics, and Gray's Inn. He learned from the best institutions in the world, understood global systems, and then returned to India to uplift millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Babasaheb conquered the world not through power or wealth, but through <strong className="text-slate-900">knowledge, intellect, struggle, vision, and extraordinary hard work</strong>. The knowledge he gained abroad became a blessing for India.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4 font-display uppercase tracking-tight">Because of his immense work, India received:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-8 marker:text-brandBlue text-slate-700">
              <li>The Constitution of India</li>
              <li>Protection of fundamental rights</li>
              <li>Equal voting rights</li>
              <li>Labour reforms</li>
              <li>Economic and financial policy vision</li>
              <li>Social justice movements</li>
              <li>Hope and dignity for millions of oppressed and poor people</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              He dedicated his entire life to ensuring that the poorest, weakest, and most marginalized people could live with dignity and self-respect.
            </p>

            <p>
              That is why today, <strong className="text-slate-900">it is our moral duty to carry forward Babasaheb’s unfinished global mission</strong>. If Babasaheb could cross oceans to bring knowledge and justice back to India, then we too must cross borders to spread his message to the world.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-8 my-10 text-center">
              <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-2">Our mission is much bigger than conducting just one event.</p>
              <p className="text-2xl font-black text-brandBlue uppercase tracking-tight font-display">We are building a global movement.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Beginning in <strong>2026, the Vishwa Leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar International Awards</strong> will be organized <strong>once every two years in different countries</strong>. By taking this platform across nations, we will connect the global Ambedkarite diaspora and diverse communities under one shared vision of justice and human dignity.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4 font-display uppercase tracking-tight">This is not only about awards. This is about:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-8 marker:text-amber-500 text-slate-700">
              <li>Building global unity</li>
              <li>Creating international networks</li>
              <li>Encouraging business, academic, and cultural collaboration</li>
              <li>Strengthening brotherhood among communities worldwide</li>
              <li>Taking Babasaheb’s message to future generations globally</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This mission will also create real benefits for our poor people in India and disadvantaged communities across the world.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold text-lg text-slate-900">How?</p>

            <p>
              When global communities connect, opportunities increase:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-8 marker:text-brandBlue text-slate-700">
              <li>International scholarships for students</li>
              <li>Business collaborations and investments</li>
              <li>Employment opportunities</li>
              <li>Skill development and mentorship</li>
              <li>Global support systems for marginalized communities</li>
              <li>Access to knowledge, technology, and progressive ideas</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When strong international networks are built, the benefits do not remain only in London or abroad — they eventually flow back to villages, towns, and cities in India where our people need support the most.
            </p>

            <p>
              The poor in India do not need only sympathy; they need <strong className="text-slate-900">opportunities, access, education, global exposure, economic empowerment, and strong networks</strong>. This global mission aims to help create exactly that.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is equally beneficial for people worldwide. Babasaheb’s teachings are not only for India. Even today, many societies across the world struggle with discrimination, inequality, exclusion, and injustice. Babasaheb’s philosophy provides powerful solutions for humanity as a whole.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6 font-display tracking-tight text-center">Our long-term vision is bold but clear.</h3>

            <p className="text-center text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In the next <strong>10–15 years</strong>, we want this award to gain such international credibility and prestige that people across the world aspire to receive it — <strong className="text-brandBlue">just as people aspire to receive the Nobel Peace Prize</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-center italic text-slate-600 mb-8">
              Yes, this is an ambitious dream.<br/>
              But every globally respected institution begins with one courageous first step.

            </div>

            <p>
              Beginning 2026, this will become a <strong className="text-slate-900">bi-yearly global event</strong>, hosted once every two years in different countries so Babasaheb’s teachings can reach new regions, cultures, and communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next event is expected to be hosted in <strong className="text-slate-900">California in 2028</strong>, further expanding the mission across continents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once the award earns global stature, future editions can be hosted across major international centres such as <strong className="text-slate-900">California, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Johannesburg, Sydney, and also India</strong>, thereby expanding Babasaheb’s influence across continents.
